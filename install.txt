### Installation ####
-Make sure that you have Matlab and Microsoft Excel installed.
-Install libSBML from http://sourceforge.net/projects/sbml/files/libsbml/5.15.0/stable/. If it asks whether it can start Matlab and install some stuff say Yes. Add libSBML installation directory to Matlab path list.
-Install Gurobi Optimizer from http://www.gurobi.com/downloads/gurobi-optimizer. Apply for Free Academic License from https://user.gurobi.com/download/licenses/free-academic. Then follow the given instructions to activate the local Gurobi installation and save gurobi.lic in the default directory. Add Gurobi installation directory to Matlab path list.
-Install Mosek (only version 7 is compatible with RAVEN) from http://mosek.com/resources/download/. Apply for an academic license from http://license.mosek.com/cgi-bin/student.py. You have to fill out all fields correctly. You will receive a file called mosek.lic after a couple of minutes. Save this file in c:\Program files\Mosek\7\licences (or wherever you have installed Mosek). If there already is a mosek.lic file then replace the old version. If you already have Mosek installed you will probably still have to apply for an academic license as they are only valid for three months. Add Mosek installation directory to Matlab path list.
-Add RAVEN to Matlab path recursively and run checkInstallation. All the tests must be successful before going on tutorials and simulations.
